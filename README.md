Deep Learning - MSc Data Science  @ City, University of London

# First part of the project: 
The purpose of this project is to train an agent using reinforcement and deep learning
techniques to solve basic and advance tasks. The initial (basic) taskâ€™s purpose is to train an
agent to find the most efficient route from Paris-Charles De Gaulle airport to Eiffel Tower in
Paris. Moreover, the data were extracted randomly using the Paris underground map with
different routes using trains and buses. The decision of agent is dependent on factors including
the shortest duration and the most economical route combined. The figure below illustrates a
specific map for different routes to the final destination with an indication of train stations
which are the states. Moreover, the environment is deterministic and does not change over time
(Static) and the current state will determine the available next states. The actions executed by
the agent is stochastic.

# Second part of the project: 
The advanced task which is Cartpole V-1 using openAI gym environment.
